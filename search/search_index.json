Install pipx On macOS: brew install pipx pipx ensurepath Upgrade pipx with brew update && brew upgrade pipx . Otherwise, install via pip: python3 -m pip install --user pipx python3 -m pipx ensurepath Upgrade pipx with python3 -m pip install --user -U pipx . Shell completions are available by following the instructions printed with this command: pipx completions For more details, see the installation instructions . Overview: What is pipx ? pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in Python. It's roughly similar to macOS's brew , JavaScript's npx , and Linux's apt . It's closely related to pip. In fact, it uses pip, but is focused on installing and managing Python packages that can be run from the command line directly as applications. How is it Different from pip? pip is a general-purpose package installer for both libraries and apps with no environment isolation. pipx is made specifically for application installation, as it adds isolation yet still makes the apps available in your shell: pipx creates an isolated environment for each application and its associated packages. pipx does not ship with pip, but installing it is often an important part of bootstrapping your system. Where Does pipx Install Apps From? By default, pipx uses the same package index as pip, PyPI . pipx can also install from all other sources pip can, such as a local directory, wheel, git url, etc. Python and PyPI allow developers to distribute code with \"console script entry points\". These entry points let users call into Python code from the command line, effectively acting like standalone applications. pipx is a tool to install and run any of these thousands of application-containing packages in a safe, convenient, and reliable way. In a way, it turns Python Package Index (PyPI) into a big app store for Python applications. Not all Python packages have entry points, but many do. If you would like to make your package compatible with pipx, all you need to do is add a console scripts entry point. If you're a poetry user, use these instructions . Features pipx enables you to Expose CLI entrypoints of packages (\"apps\") installed to isolated environments with the install command. This guarantees no dependency conflicts and clean uninstalls! Easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages that were installed with pipx Run the latest version of a Python application in a temporary environment with the run command Best of all, pipx runs with regular user permissions, never calling sudo pip install (you aren't doing that, are you? \ud83d\ude04). Walkthrough: Installing a Package and its Applications With pipx You can globally install an application by running pipx install PACKAGE This automatically creates a virtual environment, installs the package, and adds the package's associated applications (entry points) to a location on your PATH . For example, pipx install pycowsay makes the pycowsay command available globally, but sandboxes the pycowsay package in its own virtual environment. pipx never needs to run as sudo to do this. Example: >> pipx install pycowsay installed package pycowsay 2.0.3, Python 3.7.3 These apps are now globally available - pycowsay done! \u2728 \ud83c\udf1f \u2728 >> pipx list venvs are in /home/user/.local/pipx/venvs apps are exposed on your $PATH at /home/user/.local/bin package pycowsay 2.0.3, Python 3.7.3 - pycowsay # Now you can run pycowsay from anywhere >> pycowsay mooo ____ < mooo > ==== \\ \\ ^__^ (oo)\\_______ (__)\\ )\\/\\ ||----w | || || Installing from Source Control You can also install from a git repository. Here, black is used as an example. pipx install git+https://github.com/psf/black.git pipx install git+https://github.com/psf/black.git@branch # branch of your choice pipx install git+https://github.com/psf/black.git@ce14fa8b497bae2b50ec48b3bd7022573a59cdb1 # git hash pipx install https://github.com/psf/black/archive/18.9b0.zip # install a release Walkthrough: Running an Application in a Temporary Virtual Environment This is an alternative to pipx install . pipx run downloads and runs the above mentioned Python \"apps\" in a one-time, temporary environment, leaving your system untouched afterwards. This can be handy when you need to run the latest version of an app, but don't necessarily want it installed on your computer. You may want to do this when you are initializing a new project and want to set up the right directory structure, when you want to view the help text of an application, or if you simply want to run an app in a one-off case and leave your system untouched afterwards. For example, the blog post How to set up a perfect Python project uses pipx run to kickstart a new project with cookiecutter , a tool that creates projects from project templates. A nice side benefit is that you don't have to remember to upgrade the app since pipx run will automatically run a recent version for you. Okay, let's see what this looks like in practice! pipx run APP [ARGS...] This will install the package in an isolated, temporary directory and invoke the app. Give it a try: > pipx run pycowsay moo --- < moo > --- \\ ^__^ \\ (oo)\\_______ (__)\\ )\\/\\ ||----w | || || Notice that you don't need to execute any install commands to run the app . Any arguments after the application name will be passed directly to the application: > pipx run pycowsay these arguments are all passed to pycowsay! ------------------------------------------- < these arguments are all passed to pycowsay! > ------------------------------------------- \\ ^__^ \\ (oo)\\_______ (__)\\ )\\/\\ ||----w | || || Re-running the same app is quick because pipx caches Virtual Environments on a per-app basis. The caches only last a few days, and when they expire, pipx will again use the latest version of the package. This way you can be sure you're always running a new version of the package without having to manually upgrade. If the app name does not match that package name, you can use the --spec argument: pipx run --spec PACKAGE APP You can also use the --spec argument to run a specific version, or use any other pip -specifier: pipx run --spec PACKAGE==1.0.0 APP Running from Source Control You can also run from a git repository.

[bugfix] Ignore system shared libraries when installing shared libraries pip, wheel, and setuptools. This also fixes an incompatibility with Debian/Ubuntu's version of pip (#386). 0.15.1.3 [bugfix] On Windows, pipx now lists correct Windows apps (#217) [bugfix] Fixed a pipx install bug causing incorrect python binary to be used when using the optional --python argument in certain situations, such as running pipx from a Framework python on macOS and specifying a non-Framework python. 0.15.1.2 [bugfix] Fix recursive search of dependencies' apps so no apps are missed. upgrade-all now skips editable packages, because pip disallows upgrading editable packages. 0.15.1.1 [bugfix] fix regression that caused installing with --editable flag to fail package name determination. 0.15.1.0 Add Python 3.8 to PyPI classifier and travis test matrix [feature] auto-upgrade shared libraries, including pip, if older than one month. Hide all pip warnings that a new version is available. (#264) [bugfix] pass pip arguments to pip when determining package name (#320) 0.15.0.0 Upgrade instructions: When upgrading to 0.15.0.0 or above from a pre-0.15.0.0 version, you must re-install all packages to take advantage of the new persistent pipx metadata files introduced in this release. These metadata files store pip specification values, injected packages, any custom pip arguments, and more in each main package's venv. You can do this by running pipx reinstall-all or pipx uninstall-all , then reinstalling manually. install now has no --spec option. You may specify any valid pip specification for install 's main argument. inject will now accept pip specifications for dependency arguments Metadata is now stored for each application installed, including install options like --spec , and injected packages. This information allows upgrade, upgrade-all and reinstall-all to work properly even with non-pypi installed packages. (#222) upgrade options --spec and --include-deps were removed. Pipx now uses the original options used to install each application instead. (#222) upgrade-all options --include-deps , --system-site-packages , --index-url , --editable , and --pip-args were removed. Pipx now uses the original options used to install each application instead.

Pipx now uses the original options used to install each application instead. (#222) Handle missing interpreters more gracefully (#146) Change reinstall-all to use system python by default for apps. Now use --python option to specify a different python version. Remove the PYTHONPATH environment variable when executing any command to prevent conflicts between pipx dependencies and package dependencies when pipx is installed via homebrew. Homebrew can use pythonpath manipulation instead of virtual environments.

Use userpath append ~/.local/bin Support redirects and proxies when downloading python files (i.e. pipx run http://url/file.py ) Use tox for document generation and CI testing (CI tests are now functional rather than static tests on style and formatting!) Use mkdocs for documentation Change default cache duration for pipx run from 2 to 14 days 0.13.0.1 Fix upgrade-all and reinstall-all regression 0.13.0.0 Add runpip command to run arbitrary pip commands in pipx-managed virtual environments Do not raise error when running pipx install PACKAGE and the package has already been installed by pipx (#125). This is the cause of the major version change from 0.12 to 0.13. Add --skip argument to upgrade-all and reinstall-all commands, to let the user skip particular packages 0.12.3.3 Update logic in determining a package's binaries during installation.

Upgrade pipx On macOS: brew update && brew upgrade pipx Otherwise, upgrade via pip: python3 -m pip install --user -U pipx Note: Upgrading pipx from a pre-0.15.0.0 version to 0.15.0.0 or later After upgrading to pipx 0.15.0.0 or above from a pre-0.15.0.0 version, you must re-install all packages to take advantage of the new persistent pipx metadata files introduced in the 0.15.0.0 release. These metadata files store pip specification values, injected packages, any custom pip arguments, and more in each main package's venv. If you have no packages installed using the --spec option, and no venvs with injected packages, you can do this by running pipx reinstall-all .
